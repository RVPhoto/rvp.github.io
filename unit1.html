      <li>Musk's first big success was PayPal, which he helped create. eBay bought the company for $1.5 billion in 2002.</li>
      <li>After making a fortune selling PayPal, he didn't just quit to take things easy, he launched A PRIVATE SPACE COMPANY.</li>
      <li>He spent $1 million to buy the Lotus submarine car used in the 1977 James Bond film "The Spy Who Loved Me." And no one was shocked when he explained, "What I'm going to do is upgrade it with a Tesla electric powertrain and try to make it transform for real.‚Äù</li>
